//! Coding workflow — single-agent outer loop.
//!
//! The agent handles its own iteration (LLM → tool → LLM → …)
//! via `Agent::run_with_channel`. We sit around that and do three
//! things:
//!
//!   1. Snapshot the workspace when the failing-test count drops
//!      — so a later turn can't regress past the best-seen state.
//!   2. On not-green, feed the test output back into the next
//!      turn's prompt so the agent has surgical failure context.
//!   3. Stop when we're green, within a few failures of green
//!      (more iteration is more likely to regress than improve),
//!      over budget, or past the outer-iteration cap.
//!
//! We used to decompose into 7 phases (ASSESS / PLAN / EXECUTE /
//! VERIFY / REVIEW / TEST / FINALIZE). That added a lot of prompt
//! surface area and failure modes — the phase decomposition kept
//! silent-short-circuiting at one detector or another and eating
//! runs that should have kept going. A single-agent loop is
//! smaller, easier to reason about, and matches the shape of
//! tools like OpenCode that are maintained against coding
//! benchmarks. We kept the parts that demonstrably help — the
//! self-validation requirement in the system prompt, the
//! best-state snapshot, the compile-error short-circuit — and
//! dropped the per-phase dispatch.
//!
//! This module does NOT own the sandbox, the security hooks, or
//! the tool registry — the caller assembles those and hands them
//! in.
